        <p>
            I have been to Hawaii for a wrestling tournament when I was younger. I'm not sure if it was just where I was at the time but
            I really like that everything was quite and closed by 9 p.m. but everyone was up and going early which I enjoy more. I also enjoyed
            the weather because even when it rained it was still warm out.

        <h1>Las Vegas</h1>

            <figcaption>Las Vegas, a place to do anything.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Me and my wife enjoy going to vegas every couple years. We have seen various shows/events when we've gone including a UFC card as well
            as a Cirque du Soleil which I would highly recommend. My favourite restaurant that we always make sure to go to at least once per trip
            is Mon Ami Gabi located in Paris Hotel and Casino where I ironically get the burger as it's the best burger I've ever had.
